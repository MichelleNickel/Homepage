                    Hi! My name is Michelle.<br>
                    I live in Germany and am an aspiring programmer.<br>
                    In my free time i like to play video-games, hang out with friends and i am very new at snowboarding.
                    It can be quite painful as i have learned, but i still enjoy it a lot!<br>
                    Currently i attend Harvards CS50 course, this homepage is actually week 8's assignment, how did i do? :).<br>
                    I tried my hand on a few other projects as well:
                </p>

                    I am especially proud of this one. This Webpage was part of the responsive web design certificate from <a href="www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>.<br>
                    As part of the assignment, you should try to use only pure CSS and html. The coderain especially was a big challenge and as a result, what could have been a few lines of
                    code turned into roughly a hundred lines of html and an additional hundreds of lines of CSS, since the numbers had to be styled individually. As you can imagine, the sourcecode
                    now has a huge block of unnecessary code at the end that could have been avoided. But i am still proud of the result, it came out exactly as i imagined.

                <p class="txt-albert right-aligned-text">
                    Another page created for the freecodecamps responsive web design certificate. Albert Schweitzer was actually the namegiver of my high school. If you don't know anything about
                    this man, i strongly recommend the movie "Albert Schweitzer" or "Albert Schweitzer - Ein Leben für Afrika" - as it is called in germany. It is beautifully filmed biopic and shows
                    his life, his achievements and his values. He was truly a hero and a great rolemodel.

                <div class="txt-filter centered-text">
                    <h3>Filter</h3>
                    <p>
                        For CS50's week 4 Assignment we implemented a few filters on bmp files with a certain width and height in C. Then in Week 6 we learned how you can program the same
                        program in way fewer lines of code in python. So i got curious. How would it turn out if i implemented it in java?<br>
                        And so i did.<br>
                        The program is not as long as the one i coded in C, but it is not as short as the one we coded in python. The Java file you can find on my github as well.<br>
                        The readme of <a href="https://github.com/MichelleNickel/Java-Filter">that project</a> has a few examples as well, please check it out if you are interested.<br>
                        If you are curious i did not post my solutions, like the C files, for the courses assignments to my github for obvious reasons.<br>
                        The only exception is this homepage and the UFcOw-project, since the assignment has very few restrictions, so the solutions may vary a lot.
                        Therefore it would be quite stupid to copy-paste.

                <p class="txt-ufo left-aligned-text">
                    During CS50's first week we were supposed to create a little program in scratch, be it a game, an interactive story or anything else.<br>
                    What i came up with is a little game with the name "UFcOw", you can try it out <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/690086136/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
                    You are an alien that had to bring some Kettle from Earth as an assignment for school. But you are no simple alien, you are an achiever!<br>
                    You want to impress the class and steal as many cows as you can, but be careful, the farmer might not like that all that much.
