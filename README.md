# MyHomepage

https://michellenickel.github.io/Homepage/

A simple webpage structured into a few subpages.

I submitted this project as the CS50 courses week 8 assignment on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project is split into the following subpages: 

- `home`: The index page
- `about me`: A few words about me and some of my projects
- `resume`: My resume
- `contact`: How to contact me

Also there are 5 CSS files, one for each page and one for general styling. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains one folders by default:

- `images`: the folder that contains the images used in this project
